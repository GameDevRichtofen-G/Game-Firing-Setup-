# Firing in games
In many different games we have guns, which we can use to kill enemies or do N task.
from long time ago, firing in video games was a gameplay experience to give a player
an option to protect itself. In this repository I am gonna teach you how you can make
a firing system inside of your game.

# How to make a firing system
first I am gonna demonstrate this in python so it would be easier to understand.
firing has some few parameters that we need to take care of:
<br>
`Firing flag` : this is a variable that we use to indicate we are firing and we won't allow player to player if this state was true
<br>
`Fire rate` : we use this to indicate the rate of fire. in other word, this would determine how long it will take for player to shoot again
<br>
Now that we know what we need we can actually make our firing system.
## Step 1: Setup 

first include these codes so that we have a simple engine that we can work with in a python : 

```python
import time
import os

previous_frame_60 = time.time()


FRAME_TIME_60 = 1 / 60  


while True:
    current_time = time.time()

    if current_time - previous_frame_60 >= FRAME_TIME_60:
        deltaTime_60 = current_time - previous_frame_60
        previous_frame_60 = current_time
       
    os.system("cls" if os.name == "nt" else "clear") 
    Scene = [' '] * 10 #->making our scene
    print("".join(Scene)) #->Reneder our scene
    time.sleep(0.005)
```
We use to  have a simple scene and deltaTime. made this code in our previous repo with full explanation.
Here I want to make an entity system so lets make a main class as parent and later on make other instances :

```python
class Main_class():#->class itself
    Instances = [] #->We use this to store instances
    def __init__(self, x, shape): #->our init function
        self.x = x #->setting up init position on x axis
        self.shape = shape #->setting up init shape
        Main_class.Instances.append(self) #->append instance class in main class

    def OnBeginPlay(self): 
      """#->On the start of the game"""
    def Update(self, DeltaTime, Use_delta_Time):
     """#->updates each frame"""
```
Now lets call update function and begin function for all instance :
### Begin function 
add this before the while loop, this will loop through all main class instances and call on begin play function
```python
for instance_class in Main_class.Instances:
   instance_class.OnBeginPlay()
```

### Update function 
call this inside of while loop, right after we calculate the deltaTime 
```python
if current_time - previous_frame_60 >= FRAME_TIME_60:
        deltaTime_60 = current_time - previous_frame_60
        previous_frame_60 = current_time
        for instance_class in Main_class.Instances:#->go through all the instances and update them each frame
            instance_class.Update(deltaTime_60,True)
```

### Rendering 
to render our stuff we will use this code right after making the scene :
```python
    Scene = [' '] * 100

    for instance_class in Main_class.Instances:#-> go through all the instances of main class and renders them base on their x position
       Scene[int(instance_class.x)] = instance_class.shape 
    
    print("".join(Scene))
```
Now we have a basic entity system that we can work with.
### Make a gun class 
to make a gun classs, we want to make sure it is an instance of a main class like this :
```python
class Gun(Main_class):
    def __init__(self, x, shape):
        super().__init__(x, shape)  

    def Update(self, DeltaTime, Use_delta_Time):
        super().Update(DeltaTime, Use_delta_Time)  
```

Now we can create our gun class, before our while loop like this :
```python
Test_gun = Gun(0,"︻╦デ╤━╾")
```
for sake of this I will use this text as a gun model "︻╦デ╤━╾".
after this you should have something like this : 
![Description](https://github.com/GameDevRichtofen-G/Game-Firing-Setup-/blob/main/Example_gun_1.gif)


### Input function
to shoot we need an input function, I want to use pynput libary to have some input system in my game.
first download libary using this command
```
pip install pynput
```
then we want to recieve mouse input so we use mouse lib inside of pynput :
```python
from pynput import mouse
```
after than we make a listener in our gun class init function :
```python
    def __init__(self, x, shape):
        super().__init__(x, shape)  
        self.listener = mouse.Listener(on_click=self.Input)#->make listener, and tell which function to call when left mouse button was pressed
        self.listener.start()#->start the listener

```
you can see we have function called `self.input` we need to make this function like this :
```python
    def Input(self,x, y,button,pressed) :
        if button == mouse.Button.left: #->if the button we pressed was left mouse button
            if pressed: #-> if we pressed the button then do something
                """"""
            else:#->if we released it then do something else
                """"""
```


Now we have everything ready to make our firing system

## Step 2 : Firing
in this step we will see how we can make our gun fire.
as mention before we have few parameters to take of `Firing flag` and `Fire rate`
first we make a varible call firing and one for making sure are holding left mouse button in our gun class like this :
```python
    def __init__(self, x, shape):
        super().__init__(x, shape)
        self.firing = False #->our firing flag
        self.LeftMB = False #->our left mouse button
        self.listener = mouse.Listener(on_click=self.Input)
        self.listener.start()
```

then in our input function if we pressed left mouse button then we make LeftMB true:
```python
    def Input(self,x, y,button,pressed) :
        if button == mouse.Button.left:
            if pressed:
                self.LeftMB = True
            else:
               self.LeftMB = False
```

Now in our update function we will say if we were holding left mouse button and firing was not true we are shooting :
```python
    def Update(self, DeltaTime, Use_delta_Time):
        super().Update(DeltaTime, Use_delta_Time)
        if self.LeftMB and not self.firing :
            self.firing = True
```
Now we need to use fire rate to make firing false again so we can shoot again, the formula for fire rate is this :
<div align="center">
  <picture>
    <source srcset="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\large&space;{\color{black}T_{shot}=\frac{60}{RPM}}" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)">
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\large&space;{\color{white}T_{shot}=\frac{60}{RPM}}">
  </picture>
  
</div>
`RPM` stands for Round per minute which indicates how many bullet we spend each min :
now lets say our RPM is 800, which in this case we gonna say something like this :

```python
self.time = 0 #-> make a variable call time in init of gun class
```

then in update function do this :
```python
    def Update(self, DeltaTime, Use_delta_Time):
        super().Update(DeltaTime, Use_delta_Time)
        if self.LeftMB and not self.firing : #-> saying if we pressed left mouse button and firing was not true
            self.firing = True #-> we make firing true
            self.time = 60 / 800 #->we use our formula to get the fire rate
            self.shape = "︻╦デ╤━╾o" #-> change the shape of the gun

        if self.firing : #-> saying if were shooting
            

            if self.time > 0 : #->if time was greater than 0 then we subtract our time with deltaTime until it is 0
                self.time -= deltaTime_60
            else : #-> if it was 0 we make firing false again
                self.firing = False
        else :
            self.shape = "︻╦デ╤━╾"
```
now to make our gun fire bullet we can make class called bullet :
``` python
class bullet(Main_class):
    def __init__(self, x, shape):
        super().__init__(x, shape)
    
    def Update(self, DeltaTime, Use_delta_Time):
        super().Update(DeltaTime, Use_delta_Time)
        self.x = (self.x + (50 * DeltaTime if Use_delta_Time else 1)) #-> update the bullet x position using deltaTime
        if self.x > 99 : #-> if x was greater than 99 then we destroy our bullet
            Main_class.Instances.remove(self)
```

now to make our bullet we do this in our update function :
```python
        if self.LeftMB and not self.firing :
            self.firing = True
            self.time = 60 / 800
            new_bullet = bullet(self.x + 1 , '-') #->create a new class called bullet one x position ahead of the gun
            self.shape = "︻╦デ╤━╾o"

```

Final Result would be this(gif is on 25 frame per sec so sorry about lag):

Final code is on the repo

## Other things to know
In terms of shooting, it is a best to make sure your animation has a same speed as your fire rate.
sometimes, it is essential to do this because for the guns like pistol, if the player press mouse
button so fast, it is good to increase the speed of animation. A example of this is in my game radar
where if player shoot so fast the animation speed increases 
![Description](https://github.com/GameDevRichtofen-G/Game-Firing-Setup-/blob/main/Example_3_gun.gif)

so we can say by now we need to know how fast we were shooting since the last shot took place. which is so simple
the code below is example of how we can do it :
```cpp
void APlayerCharacter::Shoot()
{
  /*NOTE : make sure to have a variables called last time and current fire rate in your header class*/
  if(!Firing) /->return if we weren't firing 
    return;
  float CurrentTime = GetWorld()->GetTimeSeconds(); /#->get current time second
  float DeltaShot = CurrentTime - LastTime; /#->getting the deltaTshot or in other word the time that has passed since the last shot 
  if (DeltaShot > 0) /#-> getting the current fire rate(fire rate is actually the amount time the player press left mouse button) and we use condition so that we make sure we won't divide by zero
    CurrentFirerate = 1/DeltaShot;
  /#-> set our current time as last time 
  LastTime = CurrentTime;
  /*Here we calculate the speed of our firing, by divindg it with the maximum number of fire per sec, in my case it was 6.
   the reason I multipy with 4 is that I want my maximum speed be 4, so that if player was pressing mouse 6 times per
   sec, our shoot speed would be four, anything above get clamped and anything blow 2 will get clamped as well
   */

  ShootSpeed = FMath::Clamp((CurrentFirerate/6)*4, 2, 4);  
}
```
Click Speed (Shots/sec)   |  Animation Speed Calculation  | Final Speed (Clamped)
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
0 clicks/sec | (0 / 6) * 4 = 0.0 | 2.0 (clamped)
2 clicks/sec | (2 / 6) * 4 = 1.2 | 2.0 (clamped)
5 clicks/sec | (5 / 6) * 4 = 3.2 | 3.2 
6 clicks/sec | (6 / 6) * 4 = 4.0 | 4.0
7 clicks/sec | (7 / 6) * 4 = 4.4 | 4.0 (clamped)
